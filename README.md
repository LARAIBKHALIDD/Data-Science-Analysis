# Data-Science-Analysis
**Overview**

This repository contains three key machine learning tasks completed during my internship. Each task demonstrates data analysis, model training, and evaluation using real-world datasets.

**Tasks Included:**

Iris Dataset Classification

Credit Risk Prediction

Insurance Claim Prediction

**Task 1: Iris Dataset Classification**
**Objective:**
Visualize the species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

**Approach:**

Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.

Checked for missing values.

Visualized feature distributions and relationships using scatter plot, box plot, and histograms.

**Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction**

**Objective:**
Predict whether a customer is a good or bad credit risk based on financial and personal attributes.

**Approach:**

Loaded and explored the Credit Risk dataset.

Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Split the dataset into training and test sets.

Trained classification models, such as Logistic Regression.

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Results and Insights:

Key factors affecting credit risk included income, loan amount, and number of dependents.

**Task 3: Insurance Claim Prediction**

**Objective:**
Predict medical insurance claim amounts based on personal attributes such as age, BMI, sex, smoking status, number of children, and region.

**Approach:**

Loaded and explored the Medical Cost Personal dataset.

Checked for missing values and encoded categorical variables.

Performed EDA using scatter plots, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.

Split data into training and test sets.

Trained a Linear Regression model to predict insurance charges.

Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

**Results and Insights:**

MAE: 4181.19, RMSE: 5796.28

Smokers have significantly higher insurance charges.

Charges tend to increase with age and BMI.

Insurance companies can use this model to estimate potential claims and adjust policies accordingly.
